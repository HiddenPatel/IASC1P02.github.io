<p>Thresh<em> the chain warden</em></p>
<p>Sadistc and cunning, Thresh is an ambitious and restless spirit of the Shadow Isles. Once the custodian of countless arcane secrets, he was undone by a power greater than life or death, and now sustains himself by tormenting and breaking others.</p>

<p>R</p>
<p><strong>THE BOX</strong></p>
<p> A prison of walls that slow and deal damage if broken</p>


<p>Morgana<em>The Fallen</em></p>
<p>Conflicted between her celestial and mortal natures, Morgana bound her wings to embrace humanity, and inflicts her pain and bitterness upon the dishonest and the corrupt. She rejects laws and traditions she believes are unjust, and fights for truth.

<p>E</p>
<p><strong>BLACK SHIELD</strong></p>
<p>Morgana anoints an ally with a protective barrier of starfire, which absorbs magical damage and disabling effects until it is broken</p>

<p>R</p>
<p><strong>SOUL SHACKLES</strong></p>
<p>Morgana unleashes the full force of her Celestial power as she unbinds her wings and hovers above the ground. She lashes chains of dark pain onto nearby enemy champion, gaining Move Speed towards them. The chaisn slow and deal iniial damage and, after a delay, stun those who are unable to break them.
